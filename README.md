I love to listen to deep house dj sets on Soundcloud or Youtube. The problem is, that very there is no tracklist and Shazam doesnâ€™t work with most of the newer deep house songs so it is almost impossible to figure out what the track is called that I am listening to right now. My goal was to identify the artist of the song to make further research possible.

I built a convolutional neural network using an EC2 GPU instance. I had to learn a lot about audio engineering (e.g. Fourier Transform, MFCC), neural networks, computer vision as well as TensorFlow and Keras. While classification of a few artists works really well, it is very hard when the number increases above 20. To overcome this, I used a n most likely prediction.
